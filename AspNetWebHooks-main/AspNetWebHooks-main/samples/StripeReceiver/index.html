    <h1>Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks Stripe Receiver</h1>

    <p>
        This sample illustrates how to wire up a Stripe WebHooks receiver which can be used for
        Stripe WebHooks.
    </p>
    <h2>Direct vs Indirect WebHooks</h2>
    <p>There are two ways in which you can configure Stripe WebHooks:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Direct</dt>
        <dd>Using direct WebHooks, you register a WebHook URI with Stripe and Stripe sends the WebHook data as normal to your WebHook receiver.</dd>
        <dt>Indirect</dt>
        <dd>Using indirect WebHooks, upon receiving a WebHook, the actual WebHook data is retrieved using a follow-up HTTP GET request going back to Stripe.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If using <b>indirect</b> WebHooks, then the URI looks like this:
    </p>

    <pre>    https://&lt;host&gt;/api/webhooks/incoming/stripe/{id}?code=83699ec7c1d794c0c780e49a5c72972590571fd8</pre>

    <p>
        For security reasons the WebHook URI must be an <c>https</c> URI and contain a 'code' query parameter with the
        same value as configured in the <b>MS_WebHookReceiverSecret_Stripe</b> application setting.
        The 'code' parameter must be between 32 and 128 characters long.
    </p>
    <p>
        If using <b>direct</b> WebHooks, then the URI looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>    http://&lt;host&gt;/api/webhooks/incoming/stripe/{id}</pre>
    <p>
        In this case set the <b>MS_WebHookReceiverSecret_Stripe</b> application setting to the Stripe 'token' parameter, optionally using IDs
        to differentiate between multiple WebHooks, for example '<c>secret0, trigger=secret1</c>'.
    </p>
    <h2>Handling Test Events</h2>
    <p>
        Set the <b>MS_WebHookStripePassThroughTestEvents</b> application setting to true if you want to be able to receive test events (with Id 'evt_00000000000000').
        By default the test events will be consumed by the StripeWebHookReceiver which automatically returns a 200 response.
